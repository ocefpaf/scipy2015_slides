# The problem

- Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) likes python,
- but, but...

![](images/io_0002s_0003_layer10copy3_med.jpg)

- ... how to get hundreds of scientist using different platforms, and a myriad of configurations to reproduce their results?

> Or just to **get it** running!!!

# Can conda do it?

> - I like to think I am a dedicated "sysadmin."
> - Maybe almost like this guy ![](images/devotion_to_duty.png)
> - So when my boss told me to consider conda I promptly answer:
> - **NO!**
> - We need stable tools like `pip` and `virtualenv`
> - Build a binary in your local machine?  Upload it?  Someone else will install that thing?  **NO WAY!!!**

# The IOOS ~~Binstar~~ Anaconda Channel

> - 107 packages active packages.  (Some made it into the default channel and were deprecated along the way.)
> - Linux, Windows and OSX
> - Some really hard to compile like `iris`, `nco` and `gridgen`...
> - ...are now available via just `conda install -c ioos iris`


# How we use it?

```bash

conda config --add channels ioos

wget http://bit.ly/ioos_req -O ioos_req.txt

conda create --yes -n IOOS --file ioos_req.txt python=2.7

export PATH=$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH && source activate IOOS
```

. . .

That is it!
